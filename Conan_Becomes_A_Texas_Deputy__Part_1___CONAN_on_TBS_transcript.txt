[00:02] Speaker 1: Now I for one am a strong believer in small town justice. So here's what I did. I visited with the sheriff of Johnson County, which is located 50 miles south of Dallas, to see if I had what it takes to become a county deputy.
[00:18] Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Take a look.
[00:23] Speaker 1: I have the rare privilege of standing here with Sheriff Bob Alford of Johnson County. Sheriff, good to see you.
[00:30] Speaker 2: Mr. O'Brien, my pleasure.
[00:32] Speaker 1: Okay. So, are you going to deputize me today if I pass the test?
[00:35] Speaker 2: If you pass the test. Conan, do you mind just a little background on yourself? Do do you have a criminal record? Have you committed a felony?
[00:43] Speaker 1: I um, I stole a wheelchair about six years ago.
[00:47] Speaker 2: Did you need transportation or
[00:49] Speaker 1: I just thought it was funny. I thought it would be funny if the person came out and their wheelchair was gone. Looking back on it, it's not so funny.
[00:57] Speaker 2: At least you you see the error of your ways. So that's positive.
[01:00] Speaker 1: You're right. I will eventually stop doing it.
[01:03] Speaker 2: You're going to sign to a big deputy. Of course, you're expected to step in there and help him if necessary.
[01:09] Speaker 1: Or can I just watch from the car?
[01:12] Speaker 2: Conan, you have got to get your hands dirty. You gotta eat the beans, wear the jeans. Get in there.
[01:18] Speaker 1: I'm sorry, say that again.
[01:20] Speaker 2: Eat the beans, wear the jeans.
[01:22] Speaker 1: And wear the jeans.
[01:23] Speaker 2: Get in there with the guy.
[01:25] Speaker 1: Okay, the third part doesn't rhyme.
[01:26] Speaker 2: We have a training period you have to go through before you actually drive and what we call the lead officer. Today you're going to be the backup.
[01:36] Speaker 1: You're starting me at backup?
[01:37] Speaker 2: Yes.
[01:38] Speaker 1: Sheriff, with all due respect, I'm a celebrity.
[01:42] Speaker 2: Yes sir.
[01:43] Speaker 1: And I'm from Hollywood.
[01:44] Speaker 2: Yes sir.
[01:45] Speaker 1: So, why am I starting with backup?
[01:47] Speaker 2: You're a celebrity and you're from Hollywood.
[01:49] Speaker 1: Yeah.
[01:50] Speaker 2: Fair enough. Get back there.
[01:52] Speaker 1: Would I get to carry a gun?
[01:54] Speaker 2: Yes sir. You're going to be carrying a 6-hour 45 caliber. If you pass.
[02:01] Speaker 1: Okay. Oh my God. Did that gun I'm not very I don't know a lot about guns. Did you just fire that gun?
[02:08] Speaker 2: No sir. Decock.
[02:10] Speaker 1: Oh, that's just you're just decocking it.
[02:12] Speaker 2: Yes sir, they're both clear.
[02:12] Speaker 1: I was decocked once by a former madam and killer. So Sheriff, this is the simulator.
[02:18] Speaker 2: Oh, there'll be different scenarios set up on the screen, so you have to make that call. Can I shoot this guy, or do I talk him down, or do let him go and catch him later?
[02:28] Speaker 1: Okay.
[02:30] Speaker 3 (Computer Voice): You and your partner are responding to a silent alarm at a local bank.
[02:33] Speaker 4 (Female Voice): You stay here and I'll check out inside. It's probably just another false alarm.
[02:37] Speaker 1: Okay. She's very attractive.
[02:45] Speaker 1: What? What? What?
[02:47] Speaker 2: That was a civilian walking in there.
[02:50] Speaker 1: I don't know that. He looked like a maniac.
[02:52] Speaker 2: It happens. And you shot him in the back.
[02:54] Speaker 1: You shoot him in the back, you don't run any risks.
[02:57] Speaker 4 (Female Voice): Red cover him while I cuff him.
[03:00] Speaker 1: Okay, I got him.
[03:02] Speaker 1: Hey, whoa!
[03:06] Speaker 2: Why didn't you shoot him?
[03:07] Speaker 1: Shoot him?
[03:07] Speaker 2: You shot an innocent civilian. This guy just whooped your partners, fixing to whoop you, and you're just standing there.
[03:13] Speaker 1: Well, first of all, he was wearing a t-shirt that said World Peace.
[03:16] Speaker 2: He was. His t-shirt says World Peace.
[03:19] Speaker 4 (Female Voice): You stay out here and I'll check out inside. It's probably another false alarm.
[03:41] Speaker 2: Was anything wrong with your reaction?
[03:45] Speaker 1: I may have shot the woman and the guy coming towards the bank.
[03:50] Speaker 2: I don't think there was anything left in the scene that you didn't shoot.
[03:53] Speaker 1: What did we do?
[03:54] Speaker 1: We did get the bad guys.
[03:55] Speaker 2: We did. He was fleeing. He was not a threat. When he turns and draws the gun, he's a threat. You kill him.
[03:57] Speaker 1: Yeah. Oh, you want me to wait till he shoots at me?
[04:05] Speaker 2: Sorry.
[04:05] Speaker 1: No, thank you. You know what I like to do? I like to take out the trash before it starts to stink.
[04:11] Speaker 2: What's a jury going to say?
[04:13] Speaker 1: Jury? I won't get in front of a jury. Law doesn't touch me. Celebrities do not pay for their crimes.
[04:16] Speaker 2: Come on.
[04:19] Speaker 2: Well.
[04:21] Speaker 1: Roll that list of celebrities that got away with it. And go.
[04:47] Speaker 1: Quick question.
[04:47] Speaker 2: Yes sir.
[04:48] Speaker 1: How many people in this town know Kung Fu? I mean it seems like everyone we're running across is a Kung Fu master. I'd like to be deputized as quickly as possible, given a gun and allowed to run the streets.
[05:01] Speaker 1: I, Conan O'Brien, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the duties of the office of Deputy Sheriff.
[05:07] Speaker 2: Of the state of Texas.
[05:09] Speaker 1: State of Texas.
[05:10] Speaker 2: There you go, Conan.
[05:11] Speaker 1: Yes sir.
[05:12] Speaker 2: Congratulations.
[05:13] Speaker 1: Thank you sir. I won't let you down.
