## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Choosing the Right Model for Your Task

Selecting the right Gemini model is a trade-off between speed, cost, and analytical quality.

| Model Family      | Best For                                           | Key Trait                                       |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Pro** | Deep analysis, complex questions, nuanced content  | Highest Quality & Reasoning                     |
| **Flash** | Quick transcripts, summaries, high-volume tasks    | Speed & Efficiency (Excellent Default)          |
| **Lite / Other** | Very fast, simple tasks where speed is critical    | Maximum Speed & Lowest Cost                     |

-   **For Maximum Quality (`gemini-1.5-pro`)**: This is the most capable model. Use it for the **Analysis Mode** when you need deep, accurate insights, or for transcribing videos with challenging audio or complex terminology. It is slower and costs more per API call.

-   **For Speed & Efficiency (`gemini-1.5-flash`)**: This model provides an excellent balance of performance and cost. **`gemini-1.5-flash` is the recommended default** for most tasks, including high-quality transcriptions and quote extractions, without the higher cost of the Pro model.

-   **For Experimental Features (`...-preview`)**: Use these models with caution. They offer access to the latest features but may be unstable or change without notice. Not recommended for critical production tasks.

### Analysis Mode Best Practices

**Effective Question Types:**
```
# Summarization Questions
"What are the 3 main points discussed in this video?"
"Summarize the key arguments presented by each speaker."

# Analysis Questions  
"What evidence does the speaker provide to support their claims?"
"How do the different speakers' perspectives compare on this topic?"

# Factual Questions
"What specific statistics or data points are mentioned?"
"What examples or case studies are referenced?"
```

```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"GEMINI_API_KEY not found in environment variables"**
-   Ensure `.env` file exists in the same directory as the executable/script.
-   Verify the file contains: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_key`.
-   Check for typos in the key name (case-sensitive) and ensure no extra spaces.

**"FFmpeg not found"**
-   **Windows**: Run `python get_ffmpeg.py` before building.
-   **macOS**: Install via Homebrew: `brew install ffmpeg`.
-   **Linux**: Install via package manager: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`.

**"Failed to download audio from YouTube"**
-   Check your internet connection and verify the YouTube URL is valid and public.

**"API quota exceeded"**
-   You've hit the free tier limit for the Gemini API. Wait for the quota to reset or upgrade your account.
