## üèóÔ∏è Building Executables with PyInstaller

### Prerequisites for Building
1. Complete source installation (see Installation section)
2. PyInstaller installed: `pip install pyinstaller`
3. `.env` file with your API key
4. FFmpeg installed (for Windows builds, use `python get_ffmpeg.py`)

### Build Process

**Step 1: Prepare Environment**
```bash
# Ensure all dependencies are installed
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pyinstaller

# Download FFmpeg (Windows only)
python get_ffmpeg.py

# Verify your .env file exists with API key
cat .env
```

**Step 2: Build the Executable**
```bash
# Clean any previous builds
rm -rf build dist

# Build using the spec file
pyinstaller youtube_quote_extractor.spec --clean
```

**Step 3: Locate Your Executable**
After successful build:
```
dist/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YouTube Quote Extractor.exe    # Windows
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YouTube Quote Extractor        # macOS/Linux
```

### What Gets Bundled
The executable includes:
- ‚úÖ All Python dependencies and libraries
- ‚úÖ FFmpeg executables (for audio processing)
- ‚úÖ Runtime configuration and setup scripts
- ‚ùå **`.env` file (external - must be provided by user)**

### Distribution Setup
When sharing your executable:

1. **Share the executable file** from the `dist/` folder
2. **Provide setup instructions** for the `.env` file:
   ```
   Create a file named ".env" next to the executable with:
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. **Include this README** for complete usage instructions

### Build Troubleshooting

**Build fails with missing modules:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

**FFmpeg not found during build:**
```bash
# Windows
python get_ffmpeg.py

# macOS/Linux
brew install ffmpeg  # or equivalent package manager
```

**Executable won't start:**
- Ensure `.env` file is in the same folder as the executable
- Check that your API key is valid
- Try running from command line to see error messages

**Large executable size (100-200MB):**
- This is normal due to bundled Python runtime and AI libraries
- The size ensures the executable works on any system without dependencies

- Wait for quota reset (usually daily)
- Consider upgrading to paid tier for higher limits

**Web interface won't load**
- Check if port 8080 is available
- Try a different browser
- Disable browser extensions that might block local servers
- Check firewall settings

### Performance Tips

**For Faster Processing:**
- Use "Transcript Only" mode when you don't need quotes or analysis
- Choose `gemini-2.5-flash` or `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` for speed
- Process shorter videos (under 30 minutes) when possible
- Use higher-quality internet connection

**For Better Accuracy:**
- Choose `gemini-2.5-pro` or `gemini-1.5-pro` for complex content
- Ensure clear audio quality in source video
- Use videos with minimal background noise
- Provide descriptive timestamps for better quote context
- Use the advanced settings to customize prompts for your domain

**For Analysis Mode:**
- Ask specific, well-defined questions rather than broad queries
- Use `gemini-2.5-pro` for complex analytical tasks
- Break complex questions into smaller, focused ones
- Provide context in your questions when helpful
- Review video description first to inform your questions

**For Large Videos:**
- The system automatically chunks videos over 50 minutes
- Increase chunk overlap for better continuity
- Consider using analysis mode instead of extracting many quotes
- Ensure sufficient disk space for temporary files
- Use faster models for initial processing, then re-run with better models if needed
